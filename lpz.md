The <a href="https://ch.uni-leipzig.de/" style="color:black"><i> Computational Humanities Group </i></a> As digital technology has become ubiquitous and more an more data is becoming available in electronic form, we are witnessing what Berry calls a “computational turn in the humanities”. Computational humanities use digital tools and computational techniques to explore new modes of doing research in the humanities.

<p>Computational humanities deal with the following questions:</p>

<p>
	 <ul>
  		<li>How can humanities data – which is traditionally interpreted in an idiographic, hermeneutic way – be modeled in a way it becomes available for computational, empiric analyses?</li>
  		<li>How can existing scholarly practices in the humanities be enhanced by digital tools and algorithmic approaches that enable new, quantitative perspectives on research topics in the humanities?</li>
  		<li>How can we analyze and document our born digital cultural heritage – e.g video games, YouTube videos, Tweets, etc.? What are the requirements for digital tools and infrastructures?</li>
	</ul>
