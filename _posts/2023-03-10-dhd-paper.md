**Abstract**

In this paper we present first results from an ongoing BMBF project on FakeNarratives. In the project we investigate a socially significant class of audiovisual artifacts: TV news. We address the research hypothesis that news of this kind increasingly employs strategies of audiovisual narrative that may undercut, undermine or construct ideological positions and evaluations of news content independently of what may be simply stated, for example, in accompanying spoken text. We present first results from a comparison of Bild TV and Tagesschau and also introduce a first prototype vor the visualization and analysis of news videos.
