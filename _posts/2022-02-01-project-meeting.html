<p>
    The first project meeting took place virtually on February 1, 2022. 
    We discussed details for the individual work packages. 
    Specifically, we identified the first steps to collect news datasets that contain videos from 
    public broadcasting channels (e.g., <a href="https://tagesschau.de">Tagesschau</a>) and 
    alternative channels (e.g., <a href="https://youtube.com">YouTube</a>).
